RFC-CURP-Mexico
===============

Algorithm for getting RFC(Federal Taxpayer Register) and CURP(Unique Population Registry Code) for MÃ©xico, implemented in Javascript.

*Notes: The last character of the CURP is randomly picked in the moment of generating the curp the first time by national authorities, so we cannot calcute it realiably.*

Based on official documents:
